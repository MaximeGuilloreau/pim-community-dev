Feature: Import product information with date
  In order to use existing product information
  As a product manager
  I need to be able to import localized products

  Background:
    Given the "footwear" catalog configuration
    And I am logged in as "Julia"

  Scenario: Successfully import a csv file (with date as dd/mm/yyyy) with a date attribute
    Given the following CSV file to import:
      """
      sku;destocking_date;name-en_US
      SKU-001;28/10/2014;sku
      SKU-002;;sku
      """
    And the following job "footwear_product_import" configuration:
      | filePath   | %file to import% |
      | formatDate | d/m/Y            |
    When I am on the "footwear_product_import" import job page
    And I launch the import job
    And I wait for the "footwear_product_import" job to finish
    Then there should be 2 products
    Then the product "SKU-001" should have the following values:
      | destocking_date | 2014-10-28 |
    Then the product "SKU-002" should have the following values:
      | destocking_date | |

  Scenario: Skip product with a decimal separator different as configuration
    Given the following CSV file to import:
      """
      sku;destocking_date;name-en_US
      SKU-001;28/10/2014;
      SKU-002;28-10-2014;
      SKU-003;2014/10/28;
      SKU-004;2014-10-28;
      SKU-005;;sku
      """
    And the following job "footwear_product_import" configuration:
      | filePath   | %file to import% |
      | formatDate | Y-m-d            |
    When I am on the "footwear_product_import" import job page
    And I launch the import job
    And I wait for the "footwear_product_import" job to finish
    Then there should be 2 products
    Then I should see "skipped 3"
    Then the product "SKU-004" should have the following values:
      | destocking_date | 2014-10-28 |
    Then the product "SKU-005" should have the following values:
      | destocking_date | |
    And I should see "Format for attribute \"destocking_date\" is not respected. Format expected: \"Y-m-d\""
